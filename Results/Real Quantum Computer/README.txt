In the real quantum computer simulations, the results are NOT read in the same way as the simulator results
The following information is based off of guessing how the quantum computer maps the outputs:


Rightmost bit: The bit Bob measured
Second bit from the right: Bob's basis bit
Leftmost bit (in BB84): Alice's basis bit
